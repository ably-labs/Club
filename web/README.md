# Web client

Client application built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [TensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and [Ably](https://ably.com/).

## Pre-requisites

- Have an Ably account and get the API key
- Copy the `.env.local.example` to a new file called `.env.local` and update the api key. (Note, I'm going to replace api key with token authentication soon)

## Getting started

- Ensure you are in this directory, not the project directory.
- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Run development mode: `npm run dev`
